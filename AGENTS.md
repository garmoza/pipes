# Project Context for AI Agents

## Coding Standards
ESLint is used to check code style. Prettier is used to check the format.
There is eslint.config.json at the root of the project.
Use this information to generate code.
Use only `npm run style` for coding standards verification (no need another commands).


## Another
Never suggest running the `npm run dev` or `npm run build` command, because server already started in dev mode.
